								<p>As a data analyst, I possess a diverse range of experiences that have contributed to shaping me into the person I am today. One of my most important roles is being a devoted mother to my two boys- a 5 year old and a one year old. Balancing my responsibilities as a parent with my career aspirations has taught me the value of time management, efficiency, and flexibility.</p>
								<p>I hold a Master of Engineering degree with distinction, which is a testament to my dedication to academic excellence. During my undergraduate studies, I was the academic topper and served as a class representative for three consecutive years. I was elected as the treasurer of the department of EEE association, which gave me valuable experience in leadership and organization. Furthermore, I have experience in event planning as I served as the master of ceremony for several college events and as a throw ball captain for four years.</p>
								<p><h4>Answer to the question - 'Why so much gap after graduation?'</h4></p>

								<p> After graduating, I relocated to the United States with my husband and was unable to work for several years due to my dependent visa status. During this period, I encountered significant personal challenges, including the heartbreaking loss of my first baby shortly after birth, two surgeries, and multiple miscarriages. Despite these difficult experiences, I remained committed to my passion for data analytics. Following my physical and emotional recovery, I successfully completed a certified data analyst course, reaffirming my dedication to building a career in this field.</p>  
								<p>My diverse experiences have taught me resilience, perseverance, and a strong work ethic, which I am excited to apply to my career as a data analyst. I am eager to continue learning, growing, and contributing my skills to the field.</p>
